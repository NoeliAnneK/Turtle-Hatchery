            <h2>1.Green Turtle</h2>
            <p>Green turtles can weigh up to 230 kg and are typically 1 meter long. The Indian, Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific Oceans are just a few examples of the tropical and subtropical oceans where they can be found migrating. Turtle soup, a delicacy in many parts of the world, is made from green turtles that are trapped and slaughtered. The color of the fat found beneath their shells, which is utilized to produce the soup, is referenced in their English name. Young green turtles eat mostly meat. Although the adults are carnivorous, they only consume marine plants like seagrass and algae. The status of green turtles is currently listed as "Endangered.</p>

            <h2>2.Olive-Ridley Turtle</h2>
            <p>Of all the sea turtles, the Olive Ridley is the smallest. The adults can reach a length of 65 cm and weigh less than 40 kg. The tropical Indian, south Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans are where they are most commonly found. They consume fish, crustaceans, and some marine vegetation because they are omnivore. Currently, Olive Ridley turtles are classified as a ''Endangered'' species. Olive Ridley turtles lay their eggs on a beach in a large group known as a "Arribada" in a few nations. The arrival is the meaning of this Spanish word. For instance, during the course of a few weeks, 600,000 Olive Ridley turtles have been observed breeding in India on the same beach. Olive Ridley turtles are in danger despite having what appear to be large populations. This is because there are so many members of this species.</p>

            <h2>3.Leatherback Turtle</h2>
            <p> Of all the sea turtles, the leatherback is the biggest. They typically weigh around 600 kg and can grow to lengths of more over 2 meters. The biggest Leatherback ever discovered was 918 kg huge! They have a dorsal black color that predominates, with varying amounts of white or lighter dotting. On the neck, spots may be pinkish. In search of their prey, leatherbacks would travel great distances. They only consume jellyfish. The Leatherback turtle can live in the extreme cold because, unlike other turtles, it can control its own body temperature because layers of fatty tissue insulate its body. They have been spotted feasting on jellyfish in the waters of the Arctic Circle. Their distinctive carapace is what gives them the English name "Leatherback." Leatherback turtles are capable of deep diving.</p>

            <h2>4.Loggerhead Turtle</h2>
            <p> Loggerhed-turtleLoggerhead turtles can reach a length of 1 meter and weigh up to 180 kilograms. In addition to nesting on tropical beaches, this species also uses beaches in several temperate regions, including the Mediterranean and the South East coast of the United States. Even though this species is among the most widespread in the entire planet, it is the least common nesting species in Sri Lanka. It is crucial to act immediately to safeguard the Loggerhead turtles in Sri Lanka since they are only found there, are from the Indian subcontinent, and have distinctive coloring that suggests a distinct population with unique DNA. Mostly carnivorous, loggerhead turtles eat crabs and mollusks. The term "loggerhead" refers to the huge head that can hold a substantial, muscular set.</p>

            <h2>5.Hawksbill Turtle</h2>
            <p> As little turtles, hawksbills typically weigh 60 kg and reach lengths of 90 cm in adults. They typically consume carnivorous animals and live in tropical coastal waters near coral reefs. They eat many different kinds of creatures, including as jellyfish, sponges, and crabs. The tiny, bird-like beak that the hawksbill turtle uses to capture prey that is lurking in small crevices gives it its English name. In some cases, hawksbill turtles ingest poisonous sponges. Hawksbills may actually store the toxins in their own skin, so they aren't poisoned in the first place. A human who consumes the meat of a Hawksbill turtle risked passing away from severe food sickness. Because people have been killing hawksbill turtles for their shell for ages, their numbers are currently extremely low. Once polished and squeaky clean, the shell is crafted into ‘’tortoiseshell’’ ornaments.</p>
