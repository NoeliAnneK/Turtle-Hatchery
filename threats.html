                    <p> Along the southeast coast of the United States, hundreds of hatchling turtles leave their nests each year and swim into the Atlantic Ocean. Sadly, just one in 1,000 to 10,000 people will reach maturity. Young and adult sea turtles confront incredible natural challenges, but it is the growing risks brought on by humans that are putting them in danger of going extinct. Except for the loggerhead, which is classed as threatened, all sea turtles found in American waters are currently legally listed as endangered.</p>

                    <h2>1.Human-Caused Threats</h2>
                    <p>Although sea turtles are revered in many cultures around the world for their mythological or spiritual significance, this hasn't stopped people from eating their eggs or meat. Sea turtles have served as a source of food for many coastal cultures, particularly in Central America and Asia. Turtle hunters search the beaches at night during the nesting season in search of nesting females. They frequently wait until after the female has laid her eggs before killing her. They then take the meat and the eggs. People may also use the oil, cartilage, skin, and shell of the turtle as well as other components of the animal to make items. Although many nations restrict stealing eggs, enforcement is generally low, illegal egg harvesting is widespread, and the eggs are frequently found for sale in local markets.</p>

                    <h2>2.Marine Pollution</h2>
                    <p>Sea turtles and the food they consume can be seriously impacted by marine pollution. Fibropapillomas, a disease that is now decimating sea turtle populations, may be related to pollution in the oceans and near-shore waterways, according to recent research. Sea turtles frequently eat aquatic plant and animal life, which gets polluted and killed when it enters the ocean. Water contamination is a result of oil spills, urban runoff from chemicals, fertilizers, and petroleum. Many people mistakenly believe that because the ocean is so big, pollutants will be diluted and scattered to acceptable levels, but in fact, as the pollutants degrade in size, the toxins released from them become more concentrated. These smaller, more hazardous particles consequently serve as sustenance for several linkages throughout</p>

                    <p>Sea turtles and the food they eat may both be adversely affected by marine pollution. According to recent research, fibropapillomas, a disease that is now killing a lot of sea turtles, may be caused by pollution in the ocean and in waters close to the shore. The aquatic plant and animal life that serves as sea turtles' main source of food gets contaminated and killed when pollution enters the water. Water contamination is a result of oil spills, fertilizer runoff, chemical runoff from metropolitan areas, and petroleum. Many people mistakenly believe that because the ocean is so huge, pollutants will be diluted and dispersed to safe levels. In actuality, however, the toxins released from these pollutants get more concentrated as they degrade in size. Because of this, these smaller, more hazardous particles serve as food for several connections throughout</p>

Don’t cast your line if a sea turtle is in the area,Never feed or attempt to feed sea turtles—it is harmful and illegal!</p>
